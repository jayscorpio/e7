I should find time to update this very out-dated README...

Installation

    run install.bat (Windows)

Usage
  1. Fill/Add Excel workbook in Data folder
  2. Fill/Add Excel workbook in Plans folder
  3. run v2.py
  4. waaaaaaaait
  5. Read results in Results folder

ToDos
    1. More thresholds can be added (no more than some value, etc.) and can be more flexible in syntax since too many availabe thresholds can make the excel too wide
    2. History tracing. Retain previous results in an archive folder so that comparing and tracing can be done. It also make it possible as a service running to update results whenever the data is updated newer
